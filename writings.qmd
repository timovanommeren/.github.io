Here are a few of my selected writings. Most notably, I wrote reader for the conference [Dealing with Drugs](https://www.amsterdam.nl/dealingwithdrugs/reader/) in collaboration with leading field experts in drug policy and drug legalisation. Furthermore, I have written a few opinion pieces:

- **Dealing with Drugs Reader** — "Exploring the past and the future of drug regulation"  
  <https://www.amsterdam.nl/dealingwithdrugs/reader/>

- **DUB (Utrecht University)** — “Embracing AI in education: an urgent need for academia”  
  <https://dub.uu.nl/en/opinion/embracing-ai-education-urgent-need-academia>

- **Normaal Over Drugs** — "Singapore is a classic example of failed drug policy"  
  <https://normaaloverdrugs.nl/singapore-schoolvoorbeeld-van-mislukt-drugsbeleid/>

- **Normaal Over Drugs** — "The Dutch should be ashamed of their drug policy"
