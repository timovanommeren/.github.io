Here are a few of my selected writings. Most notably, I wrote reader for the conference [Dealing with Drugs](https://www.amsterdam.nl/dealingwithdrugs/reader/) in collaboration with leading field experts in drug policy and drug legalisation. Furthermore, I have written a few opinion pieces:

- **DUB (Utrecht University)** — *Opinion:* “Embracing AI in education: an urgent need for academia”  
  <https://dub.uu.nl/en/opinion/embracing-ai-education-urgent-need-academia>

- **Normaal Over Drugs** — *Singapore*  
  <https://normaaloverdrugs.nl/singapore-schoolvoorbeeld-van-mislukt-drugsbeleid/>

- **Normaal Over Drugs** — *(National) pride and shame in moral progress*
