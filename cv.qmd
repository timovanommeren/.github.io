## Profile

I’m a **Methodology & Statistics** master’s student at **Utrecht University** with a background in **Psychological Methods** (BSc, honours, cum laude). I work at the intersection of **quantitative methods**, **reproducible research**, and **policy-relevant analysis**—with particular experience in **drug policy** and public-facing knowledge products.

I enjoy translating complex topics for non-specialist audiences (e.g., policymakers, busy professionals) while keeping the underlying assumptions and evidence transparent.
